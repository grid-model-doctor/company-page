# Five Common Errors in CYME Models (and How to Avoid Them)


CYME is a powerful tool for modeling, analyzing, and simulating electric distribution systems. However, even experienced engineers can run into modeling pitfalls that compromise the validity or performance of their studies. Whether you're performing power flow analysis, protection coordination, or DER integration studies, avoiding these common mistakes can save hours of debugging and deliver more accurate results.

Here are five frequent errors to watch for in CYME models—and strategies to prevent them.

### 1. **Phase Mismatch Between Equipment and Buses**

**The problem:** Equipment such as regulators, transformers, or loads are sometimes modeled as three-phase while being connected to single- or two-phase buses (or vice versa). This leads to convergence errors or unrealistic simulation results.

**How to avoid it:**

* Use the **“Connectivity Check”** tool in CYME to identify phase mismatches.
* Always confirm that the number of phases for buses and connected equipment match.
* Use clear naming conventions to indicate phases (e.g., `_A`, `_AB`, `_ABC`).

### 2. **Missing or Incorrectly Modeled Grounding**

**The problem:** Ungrounded or improperly grounded transformers and network segments can lead to unrealistic voltage profiles and invalid fault current calculations.

**How to avoid it:**

* Explicitly specify grounding for transformer windings and neutral points.
* For Wye-Grounded configurations, ensure the ground impedance is set correctly (often 0 or a small value depending on utility standards).
* Review the "Grounding Configuration" tab for each element—especially in substations and DER interfaces.

### 3. **Improper Load Allocation**

**The problem:** Loads are assigned without realistic spatial or phase diversity, resulting in overestimated peak loading on certain feeders or unrealistic load flow profiles.

**How to avoid it:**

* Use CYME’s **load allocation** module to distribute system or feeder-level load to individual customer points or transformers.
* Validate against SCADA or AMI data when available.
* Consider temporal load diversity by simulating with multiple load profiles (e.g., residential vs. commercial).

### 4. **Unrealistic Line Impedance Data**

**The problem:** Line or cable parameters are copied generically across the network without reflecting actual conductor types, lengths, or configurations. This skews voltage drop and loss calculations.

**How to avoid it:**

* Use CYME’s **conductor libraries** to select realistic line types.
* For custom conductors, ensure positive- and zero-sequence impedances are derived from actual configurations or field measurements.
* Run sensitivity checks to see how line parameter variation affects your results.

### 5. **Neglecting Time-Varying Elements**

**The problem:** Elements like capacitor banks, switches, and DERs are often modeled statically—ignoring their time-varying behavior (e.g., switched capacitor banks or solar PV generation).

**How to avoid it:**

* Leverage CYME’s **Time-Series Simulation** tools to model daily or seasonal variations.
* Incorporate switching schedules and solar irradiance/load profiles.
* Consider how inverter control settings (e.g., volt-var, volt-watt) influence network dynamics.

### Conclusion

CYME is an invaluable platform for distribution system modeling, but the quality of its results hinges on careful data entry and validation. By paying attention to the issues above, you can avoid misleading results and build robust, reliable models. Investing time in connectivity validation, correct phasing, and realistic assumptions goes a long way—especially as utilities increasingly rely on CYME for planning in a DER-rich, dynamic grid environment.
